# Interface-usage-for-Rectangular-Class
In this project we use Interface Class to make signatures for rectangle class, that is inherited from the interface.
Rectangle class have two points that define rectangle, and method with bool type that check if one rectangle intersect another. Signatures are in the interface. In the main program an array of rectangle object is made.
